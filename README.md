# No-History
A locally runnable page to go places without it showing up in your search history.

No-History is useful for people who are unable to go incognito/clear their history.

No-History also comes with a proxy (which may or may not be blocked) to let it work with more sites (because many sites dont work without a proxy) and to unblock things at school.


To run locally, download <a href='https://github.com/NarwhalKid/No-History/archive/refs/heads/main.zip'>this</a> and open index.html. To open it again, go into your files, find the folder, and open index.html, OR just save it as a bookmark by clicking the star icon at the top. Show your bookmarks bar with ctrl + shift + b.

To use online, go <a href='https://www.narwhalkid.com/history/'>here</a>.
